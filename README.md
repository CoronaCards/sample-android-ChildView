sample-android-ChildView
=======================

This example shows you how to __embed__ a CoronaView within a RelativeLayout.  Another CoronaView is embedded inside the CoronaView.

# Code Overview

## CoronaView setup (Java)

The CoronaView is instantiated just like any normal view.

## CoronaView contents (Lua)

The contents of the `CoronaView` are determined via Lua. In this project, the `CoronaView` is told to look for Lua files in the `Fishies` folder of the `assets` directory.

# Setup

The sample expects the Corona .jar files to be placed in app/libs and the Corona .so files to be placed in app/src/main/jniLibs.
