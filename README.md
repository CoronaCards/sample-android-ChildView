sample-android-ChildView
========================

This example shows you how to __embed__ a CoronaView within a RelativeLayout.  Another CoronaView is embedded inside the CoronaView.

# Code Overview

## CoronaView setup (Java)

The CoronaView is instantiated just like any normal view.

## CoronaView contents (Lua)

The contents of the `CoronaView` are determined via Lua. In this project, the `CoronaView` is told to look for Lua files in the `Fishies` folder of the `assets` directory.

# Setup

The sample expects the `CoronaCards.aar` file to be placed in app/libs.

See [CoronaCards Setup (Android)](http://docs.coronalabs.com/coronacards/android/project.html) for more info.


# Requirements

See [System Requirements](http://docs.coronalabs.com/coronacards/android/project.html#system-requirements).


# Version Notes

2019, August 30: project was updated to use modern android plugin and AAR distribution of Corona Cards
